# Welcome to _blueGRS_!
Documentation for new team members to familiarize with blueGRS workflow. 

Files to generate the images used in this readme are located in the repository
in case documentation updates are required.

## Github Workflow
All _blueGRS_ repositories must follow this workflow in order to ensure a working 
version is always publicly available. New team members can run a working version
of the project on the master (release) branch before jumping into the development 
(staging) branches to add new features.

Any questions regarding the _Github Workflow_ should be directed to Daniel Hamilton
[(**@sweatpantsdanny**)](https://github.com/sweatpantsdanny).
