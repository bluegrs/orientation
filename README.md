Files to generate the images used in this readme are located in the repository
in case documentation updates are required.

## Current Projects

**Blueberry-Pi**

> A glove that tracks the user's hand orientation precisely with 9 degrees of freedom. The glove sends a server hand orientation data wirelessly to be used as a controller for video games, simulation, or 3D modeling. The project will also include a driver that the server can install to communicate with the device and interpret the data that it sends.

**Dark Blue Sky**

> A space exploration video game where the player is a most-wanted space pirate who wonders around space stealing money from travelers, racing around asteroids at high speed, and running away from space police. _Dark Blue Sky_ is designed to be the first Blueberry-Pi compatible software, showing one practical way that the glove could be used.

## Git Workflow
**Summary**

> All _blueGRS_ repositories must follow this workflow in order to ensure a working 
version is always publicly available. New team members can run a working version
of the project on the master (release) branch before jumping into the development 
(staging) branches to add new features.
